# RCOM_Lab1

This project consisted of the development and testing of a data link protocol as the first work of the Computer Networks curricular unit. Data transmission uses as a medium an asynchronous serial port and must be prepared to identify, and handle cases of error, whether they refer to data or to communication failures. The project was successfully completed.
